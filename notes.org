* This is not about me and my career.
** My career path is too strange anyway.
* I want to tell you why I'm still here.
** You shouldn't be here because it's a safe career choice.
** You shouldn't be here because it's going to pay well.
* Let's look at the world right now.
** We live large parts of our lives on the internets.
*** Socialising: Facebook Twitter Instagram Whatsapp etc
*** Commerce: Amazon Paypal Groupon etc
** We *administrate* our lives through the internets.
*** Government services, banking, health care etc
** These days, being internets illiterate is a severe handicap.
* Most people are consumers.
** They consume services, not just content.
** They take what they're given because there's nothing else.
** They're at the mercy of those who can produce.
** Those who can produce in turn consume the consumers.
** They can mistreat you however they please and you have no recourse.
* But we are wizards!
** My Emacs, let me show you it.
*** I put a puppy there because I felt there should be a puppy there.
*** I took this Emacs and made it my own.
** I got sick of Gmail so I built a mail server for myself.
** I wanted to teach people how to make games so I built this editor.
** If there's something I can't do, I know I can learn it if I'm excited about it.
** This gives me agency!
*** This agency is absent in those who can't do programming.
** Learning things is amazing. Figuring things out is amazing.
** But the most amazing thing of all is being able to shape your world.
* I'm here because I can change the world. Nothing else matters.
** You should change the world too.
